# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DATA
Completed this project as part of my BI with PowerBI course with United Network of Professionals (UNP).
Key Highlights:
The Power BI supply chain data report provides an analysis of sales, profit, customer distribution and delivery performance.
Consumer segments leads in sales, with fishing gear and cleats being the most profitable categories.
The U.S. and Puerto Rico show the highest sales per customer and Europe dominates totale sales and profitability.
Recommendations focus on targeted marketing, improving logistics and revitalizing underperforming categories.
